# GradeCal_System
The system takes the studentâ€™s percentage score as input.
The grades are calculated as follows:
90-100: Grade A
80-89: Grade B
70-79: Grade C
60-69: Grade D
Below 60: Fail
After calculating the grade, the system displays the grade and a suitable message (e.g., "Well done!" or "Please try harder next time").
